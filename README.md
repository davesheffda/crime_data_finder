# crime_data_finder

Summary

- A project retrieves crime data for a specific location from the Police API and present this data in a user-friendly way.
- The application uses the IP address of the users device to find the latitude and longitude of their location before using this latitude and longitude to retrieve relevant data from the Police API.
- The application then transforms the received data and outputs it in to a useful and readable format for the user.

Real World Application
- This application would be useful either for remote workers who change location within the UK regularly of for anyone who travels regularly within the UK.
- Whenever the user arrives in a new location within the UK, running the application will quickly provide them with information about where the closest police station is, how best to contact the local police in an emergency or non-emergency and what the latest crime statistical trends there are that they may need to be aware of so that they can remain safe in their new location.
